Some projects I made in python and R.

The most recent once are the "mozilla-release-analysis". They are the files I used for my research project in the course "Fouille de référence pour la mise en production".
The python file is not really developed because I mainly focused on the R analysis. The python code was used to retrieve data from html pages.

I also joined some older projects that may show my capacities in python and R also.
- artificial-intelligence : a compilation of projects I made in Automn 2017 for an AI course. The projects were all in python. My first contact with that language.
- machine-learning : a compilation of projects I made in Winter 2018 for a machine learning course. The projects were all in R. My first contact with that language.
- machine-recommandation-system : a compilation of projects I made in Automn 2018 for a recommandation system course. The projects were all in R.

I might be less able to remember what I had to do in those projects but it still shows my capacities.
